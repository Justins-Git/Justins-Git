## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
##
## My name is Justin Talbot and I am a third year at Rochester Institute of Technology.
## I am doing an individualized BS program involving front-end, back-end, data management, and whatever else piques my interest.
##
## I will eventually add more details here about personal projects I am working on and a link to my website once I publish it.
